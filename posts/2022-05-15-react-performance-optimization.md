# React Performance Optimization: Beyond the Basics

React applications can suffer from performance issues as they grow. Here are advanced techniques for maintaining fast, responsive React apps.

## Profiling and Measurement

Understanding what to measure and how to interpret React DevTools Profiler results is crucial for effective optimization.

## Memoization Strategies

Strategic use of React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback can prevent unnecessary re-renders and expensive calculations.

```jsx
const ExpensiveComponent = React.memo(({ data, onUpdate }) => {
  const processedData = useMemo(() => 
    expensiveProcessing(data), [data]
  );
  
  const handleUpdate = useCallback((id) => {
    onUpdate(id);
  }, [onUpdate]);
  
  return <div>{/* Component content */}</div>;
});
```

## Code Splitting and Lazy Loading

Breaking your application into smaller chunks and loading them on-demand reduces initial bundle size and improves loading times.

## Virtual Scrolling

For large lists, virtual scrolling renders only visible items, dramatically improving performance with thousands of items.

## Conclusion

React performance optimization requires measurement, understanding of React's rendering behavior, and strategic application of optimization techniques.
