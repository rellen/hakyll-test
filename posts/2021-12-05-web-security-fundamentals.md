# Web Security Fundamentals Every Developer Should Know

Web security is not optional in today's threat landscape. Understanding these fundamentals can protect your applications and users from common attacks.

## Authentication vs Authorization

Understanding the difference between proving identity (authentication) and granting permissions (authorization) is foundational to secure system design.

## Common Vulnerabilities and Prevention

The OWASP Top 10 provides a roadmap for addressing the most critical web application security risks.

## Secure Communication

HTTPS, certificate pinning, and proper TLS configuration ensure secure data transmission between clients and servers.

## Input Validation and Sanitization

Never trust user input. Proper validation and sanitization prevent injection attacks and data corruption.

## Conclusion

Security must be built into applications from the ground up. Regular security audits and staying updated on emerging threats are essential practices.
