# Python Async Programming: From Basics to Advanced Patterns

Python's asyncio library enables building high-performance, concurrent applications. Mastering async patterns unlocks Python's concurrency potential.

## Understanding the Event Loop

The event loop is the heart of async Python, managing coroutine execution and I/O operations efficiently.

## Async Context Managers and Iterators

Implementing proper resource management with async context managers and handling streaming data with async iterators.

```python
async def process_stream(source):
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        async for item in source:
            result = await process_item(session, item)
            yield result
```

## Concurrency Patterns

Using asyncio.gather(), asyncio.as_completed(), and asyncio.wait() for different concurrency scenarios.

## Error Handling

Proper exception handling in async code requires understanding how exceptions propagate through the event loop.

## Performance Monitoring

Profiling async applications and identifying bottlenecks in concurrent code.
