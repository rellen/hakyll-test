# Advanced TypeScript Patterns for Large-Scale Applications

TypeScript's type system enables sophisticated patterns that improve code quality and developer experience in large codebases.

## Generic Constraints and Conditional Types

Advanced type-level programming enables creating flexible, reusable APIs with strong type safety.

```typescript
type ApiResponse<T> = T extends string 
  ? { message: T } 
  : { data: T };

function handleResponse<T>(response: ApiResponse<T>): T {
  return 'data' in response ? response.data : response.message;
}
```

## Mapped Types and Template Literals

TypeScript's mapped types and template literal types enable powerful transformations at the type level.

## Discriminated Unions

Using discriminated unions helps model complex domain logic with type safety and exhaustiveness checking.

## Module Augmentation

Extending existing types and libraries while maintaining type safety across your application.

## Performance Considerations

Understanding TypeScript's compilation performance characteristics helps maintain fast builds in large projects.
