# Mastering Async JavaScript Patterns for Better Performance

JavaScript's asynchronous nature is both a superpower and a source of complexity. Understanding the right patterns can dramatically improve your application's performance and user experience.

## Promise Composition Strategies

Promises provide elegant ways to compose asynchronous operations. Understanding when to use `Promise.all()`, `Promise.race()`, and `Promise.allSettled()` can optimize your async workflows.

```javascript
// Parallel execution for independent operations
const results = await Promise.all([
  fetchUserData(userId),
  fetchUserPreferences(userId),
  fetchUserActivity(userId)
]);
```

## Async Generators for Streaming Data

Async generators offer powerful patterns for handling streaming data and implementing backpressure in JavaScript applications.

## Worker Threads for CPU-Intensive Tasks

Modern JavaScript environments support worker threads, allowing you to offload CPU-intensive tasks without blocking the main thread.

## Conclusion

Mastering these async patterns enables you to build responsive, high-performance JavaScript applications that provide excellent user experiences even under heavy load.
