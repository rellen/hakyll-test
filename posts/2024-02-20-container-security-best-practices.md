# Container Security Best Practices for Production Environments

Container security requires a comprehensive approach covering image security, runtime protection, and orchestration security.

## Image Security Fundamentals

Building secure container images starts with minimal base images, regular security scanning, and proper secret management.

## Runtime Security

Implementing runtime protection with tools like Falco, proper resource limits, and security contexts.

## Network Security

Container networking security including network policies, service mesh security, and ingress protection.

## Secrets Management

Proper handling of secrets in containerized environments using tools like Vault, Kubernetes secrets, and external secret operators.

## Compliance and Monitoring

Meeting compliance requirements and implementing comprehensive security monitoring for container environments.
