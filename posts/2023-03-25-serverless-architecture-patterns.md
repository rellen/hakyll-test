# Serverless Architecture Patterns for Modern Cloud Applications

Serverless computing has transformed how we build and deploy applications. Understanding key patterns helps leverage serverless effectively.

## Event-Driven Architecture

Serverless functions excel in event-driven systems, responding to triggers from various sources like databases, message queues, and HTTP requests.

## Function Composition Patterns

Composing multiple functions to create complex workflows while maintaining loose coupling and scalability.

## State Management

Handling state in stateless functions requires careful design using databases, caches, and event sourcing patterns.

## Cold Start Optimization

Minimizing cold start latency through function warming, connection pooling, and runtime optimization.

## Cost Optimization

Understanding pricing models and optimization strategies to minimize serverless computing costs.
