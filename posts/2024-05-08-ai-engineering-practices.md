# AI Engineering Practices: Building Reliable AI-Powered Applications

As AI becomes integrated into production systems, engineering practices must evolve to handle the unique challenges of AI-powered applications.

## AI System Architecture

Designing systems that incorporate AI models while maintaining reliability, scalability, and maintainability.

## Model Lifecycle Management

Managing model training, versioning, deployment, and retirement in production environments.

## Data Quality and Governance

Ensuring data quality, lineage, and governance for AI systems that depend on high-quality training and inference data.

## Monitoring AI Systems

Implementing comprehensive monitoring for model performance, data drift, and system health in AI applications.

## Ethical AI and Bias Mitigation

Building fairness, accountability, and transparency into AI systems through engineering practices and governance.
