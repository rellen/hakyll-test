# Deploying Machine Learning Models to Production at Scale

Moving machine learning models from research to production involves unique challenges. Here's a comprehensive guide to ML deployment best practices.

## Model Versioning and Management

Proper model versioning, artifact storage, and metadata tracking are essential for maintaining production ML systems.

## Serving Infrastructure

Choosing between batch processing, real-time serving, and streaming inference depends on your use case requirements and latency constraints.

```python
# Example model serving with FastAPI
from fastapi import FastAPI
import joblib

app = FastAPI()
model = joblib.load("trained_model.pkl")

@app.post("/predict")
async def predict(features: dict):
    prediction = model.predict([list(features.values())])
    return {"prediction": prediction[0]}
```

## Monitoring and Drift Detection

ML models degrade over time due to data drift. Implementing monitoring for model performance and data distribution changes is crucial.

## A/B Testing for ML

Testing model improvements in production requires careful experimental design and statistical analysis to ensure valid results.

## Conclusion

Production ML requires engineering discipline beyond model accuracy. Focus on reliability, monitoring, and continuous improvement for successful ML deployments.
