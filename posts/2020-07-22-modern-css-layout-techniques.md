# Modern CSS Layout Techniques That Will Transform Your Designs

CSS has evolved dramatically in recent years, giving us powerful new tools for creating responsive, flexible layouts. Let's explore some of the most impactful modern CSS features.

## CSS Grid: The Game Changer

CSS Grid has revolutionized how we approach layout design. Unlike flexbox, which is primarily one-dimensional, Grid allows for true two-dimensional layouts with precise control over both rows and columns.

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));
  gap: 2rem;
}
```

## Container Queries: The Future of Responsive Design

Container queries allow components to respond to their container's size rather than the viewport, enabling truly modular responsive design.

## Subgrid: Perfect Alignment

The subgrid feature extends CSS Grid by allowing nested grids to participate in their parent's grid structure, creating perfect alignment across complex layouts.

## Conclusion

These modern CSS features enable designers and developers to create more sophisticated, maintainable layouts with less code and better browser support than ever before.
