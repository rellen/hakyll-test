# Advanced Go Concurrency Patterns for Scalable Applications

Go's concurrency model with goroutines and channels enables elegant solutions to complex concurrent programming challenges.

## Worker Pool Pattern

Implementing worker pools helps manage resource usage and provides backpressure for high-throughput systems.

```go
func workerPool(jobs <-chan Job, results chan<- Result) {
    for j := range jobs {
        result := process(j)
        results <- result
    }
}
```

## Pipeline Pattern

Chaining operations through channels creates efficient data processing pipelines with natural flow control.

## Fan-in and Fan-out

These patterns help distribute work across multiple goroutines and collect results efficiently.

## Context for Cancellation

The context package provides elegant cancellation and timeout mechanisms for concurrent operations.

## Conclusion

Go's concurrency primitives enable building scalable, efficient applications. Understanding these patterns helps leverage Go's strengths effectively.
