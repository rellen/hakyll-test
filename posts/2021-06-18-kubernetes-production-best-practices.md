# Kubernetes Production Best Practices: Lessons from the Trenches

Running Kubernetes in production requires careful planning and adherence to best practices. Here are hard-learned lessons from real-world deployments.

## Resource Management and Limits

Proper resource requests and limits are crucial for cluster stability and efficient resource utilization.

```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    memory: "64Mi"
    cpu: "250m"
  limits:
    memory: "128Mi"
    cpu: "500m"
```

## Health Checks and Probes

Implementing proper liveness, readiness, and startup probes ensures reliable service availability and smooth deployments.

## Security Hardening

Network policies, RBAC, pod security policies, and secret management are essential for production security.

## Monitoring and Observability

Comprehensive monitoring with Prometheus, Grafana, and distributed tracing provides visibility into cluster health and application performance.

## Disaster Recovery Planning

Regular backups, tested restore procedures, and multi-cluster strategies protect against catastrophic failures.

## Conclusion

Kubernetes production success requires attention to security, monitoring, resource management, and disaster recovery. Investing in these areas upfront prevents costly outages later.
