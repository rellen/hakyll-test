# Distributed Systems Fundamentals: CAP Theorem and Beyond

Understanding distributed systems theory is crucial for building reliable, scalable applications. Let's explore fundamental concepts and trade-offs.

## CAP Theorem in Practice

The CAP theorem states you can only guarantee two of: Consistency, Availability, and Partition tolerance. Real systems require nuanced approaches.

## Consensus Algorithms

Raft, PBFT, and other consensus mechanisms enable distributed systems to agree on state despite failures.

## Event Sourcing and CQRS

These patterns help manage state in distributed systems while providing audit trails and scalability benefits.

## Monitoring Distributed Systems

Observability in distributed environments requires distributed tracing, correlation IDs, and comprehensive logging strategies.

## Failure Modes and Recovery

Understanding how distributed systems fail and implementing proper recovery mechanisms.
