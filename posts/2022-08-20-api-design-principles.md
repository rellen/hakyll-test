# RESTful API Design Principles for Modern Applications

Well-designed APIs are the backbone of modern applications. Following REST principles and best practices ensures maintainable, scalable APIs.

## Resource-Oriented Design

Design your API around resources rather than actions, using HTTP methods to represent operations on those resources.

## Consistent Naming Conventions

Use clear, consistent naming for endpoints, parameters, and response fields to improve developer experience.

## Proper HTTP Status Codes

Using appropriate status codes helps clients understand the result of their requests and handle errors gracefully.

## Versioning Strategy

Plan for API evolution with a clear versioning strategy that allows backward compatibility while enabling improvements.

## Documentation and Testing

Comprehensive documentation and automated testing ensure your API is reliable and easy to use.
