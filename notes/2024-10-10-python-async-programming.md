# Python Async Programming with asyncio

Asynchronous programming in Python allows you to handle many operations concurrently, especially useful for I/O-bound tasks.

## Basic Async/Await

```python
import asyncio
import aiohttp

async def fetch_url(session, url):
    async with session.get(url) as response:
        return await response.text()

async def main():
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        tasks = [
            fetch_url(session, f"https://api.example.com/data/{i}")
            for i in range(10)
        ]
        results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
        return results

# Run the async function
asyncio.run(main())
```

## Event Loop

The event loop is the core of async programming in Python:

```python
# Get the current event loop
loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()

# Schedule a coroutine
loop.create_task(my_coroutine())

# Run until complete
loop.run_until_complete(my_coroutine())
```

## Common Patterns

- Use `asyncio.gather()` for concurrent execution
- Use `asyncio.wait_for()` for timeouts
- Use `asyncio.Queue` for producer-consumer patterns
