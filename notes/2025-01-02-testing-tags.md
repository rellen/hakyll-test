This note demonstrates the tag functionality. Each tag should appear as a styled badge.

The tags are defined in the YAML frontmatter and should render as:

- Individual styled elements
- With proper spacing
- Using theme-appropriate colors

This validates that the note template and CSS implementation are working correctly.
