# PostgreSQL Performance Tuning Essentials

PostgreSQL performance can be dramatically improved with proper configuration and query optimization techniques.

## Key Configuration Parameters

```sql
-- Memory settings
shared_buffers = '256MB'
work_mem = '4MB'
maintenance_work_mem = '64MB'

-- Checkpoint settings
checkpoint_completion_target = 0.9
wal_buffers = '16MB'
```

## Query Optimization

- Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to understand query plans
- Create appropriate indexes for frequent queries
- Avoid `SELECT *` in production code
- Use connection pooling to reduce overhead

## Monitoring

Set up monitoring for slow queries, connection counts, and buffer hit ratios to identify performance bottlenecks early.
