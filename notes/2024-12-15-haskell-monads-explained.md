# Understanding Monads in Haskell

Monads are one of the most powerful abstractions in Haskell, providing a clean way to handle computations with context.

## What is a Monad?

A monad is a type class that defines three operations:
- `return` (or `pure`)
- `>>=` (bind)
- `>>` (sequence)

## Common Examples

- **Maybe**: Handling nullable values
- **IO**: Managing side effects
- **List**: Non-deterministic computations
- **State**: Stateful computations

Monads allow us to chain operations while abstracting away the plumbing of context management.
