# Advanced React Hooks Patterns

React hooks have revolutionized how we write components. Here are some advanced patterns that can improve your React applications.

## Custom Hooks for Data Fetching

```javascript
function useApi(url) {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    fetch(url).then(res => res.json()).then(setData);
  }, [url]);
  
  return { data, loading };
}
```

## Compound Component Pattern

Using hooks to create flexible, reusable component APIs that maintain internal state while exposing control to parent components.
