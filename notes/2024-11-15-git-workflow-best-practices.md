# Git Workflow Best Practices

Effective Git workflows improve team collaboration and code quality. Here are proven practices for different team sizes.

## Branch Naming Conventions

- `feature/user-authentication`
- `bugfix/login-validation`
- `hotfix/security-patch`
- `docs/api-documentation`

## Commit Message Format

```
type(scope): subject

body

footer
```

Example:
```
feat(auth): add OAuth2 integration

Implement Google and GitHub OAuth2 providers for user authentication.
Includes proper error handling and token refresh logic.

Closes #123
```

## Code Review Process

- Keep PRs small and focused
- Write descriptive PR descriptions
- Address feedback promptly
- Use draft PRs for work-in-progress
