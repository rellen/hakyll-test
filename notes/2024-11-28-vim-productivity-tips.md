# Vim Productivity Tips for Developers

Vim's efficiency comes from its modal editing and powerful text manipulation commands. Here are some tips to boost your productivity.

## Movement Commands

- `w` - Jump to next word
- `b` - Jump to previous word  
- `f{char}` - Find character forward
- `t{char}` - Till character forward
- `/{pattern}` - Search forward

## Text Objects

- `ciw` - Change inner word
- `ca(` - Change around parentheses
- `dit` - Delete inner tag
- `yi"` - Yank inner quotes

## Macros

Record repetitive actions with `q{register}`, then replay with `@{register}`. This can save hours on repetitive editing tasks.
