# GraphQL vs REST - When to Use Each

Both GraphQL and REST have their place in modern web development. Understanding when to use each is crucial for making the right architectural decisions.

## GraphQL Advantages

- **Single endpoint**: One URL for all data operations
- **Precise data fetching**: Request exactly what you need
- **Strong type system**: Self-documenting schema
- **Real-time subscriptions**: Built-in support for live data

```graphql
query {
  user(id: "123") {
    name
    email
    posts {
      title
      publishedAt
    }
  }
}
```

## REST Advantages

- **Simplicity**: Easy to understand and implement
- **Caching**: HTTP caching works out of the box
- **Tooling**: Mature ecosystem of tools
- **Stateless**: Each request contains all needed information

## When to Choose GraphQL

- Complex data relationships
- Mobile apps with bandwidth constraints
- Rapid frontend development
- Need for real-time updates

## When to Choose REST

- Simple CRUD operations
- Heavy caching requirements
- Team unfamiliar with GraphQL
- File uploads and downloads
